# Python-Calculator
This is a simple Python calculator I made myself!

# Notes:
I dont know how you will run this since it asks the questions in the terminal/console.
You can use an online Python interpreter like [this one!][1] Or if you have [Visual Studio Code][3], you can open the .py file and click run!

Releases [here!][2]
